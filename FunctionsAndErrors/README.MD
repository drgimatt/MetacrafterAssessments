# Functions and Errors - ETH + AVAX

This contains the necessary files for the module project Functions and Errors - ETH + AVAX under the ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course by Metacrafters. The Functions and Errors project showcases the use of Functions and Error Handling in Solidity to ensure that learners know how to streamline their code as well as to write contracts that are not susceptible to common errors.

## Description

This repository contains a .sol file which contains Solidity code that is written to adhere to the requirements specified in the Project page for "Functions and Errors - ETH + AVAX". It is written to use variables, functions, and error handling functions. The smart contract allows the owner to set a specified value and make a comparison whether if the number in question is equal to the initially set value. 

## Features

- Set a specified value and reset the value to its original state (only by the owner)
- Compare a given number with the set value and provide a simple text regarding the result
- Error handling for invalid operations (Require, Assert, Revert)

## Getting Started

### Opening the Contract

This contract is written in Solidity, as such, it can be run by any IDE that is configured to use Solidity. An option available is to use Remix, an online Solidity IDE, is a simple and fast option to run the contract. To get started, go to https://remix.ethereum.org/.

### Compiling the Contract

On the Remix website, create a new file by clicking the "+" icon on the left-hand sidebar and save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the code into the file. To compile the code, click the compiler tab on the left-hand sidebar and set the compiler version to the version specified on the file and click "Compile".

### Running the Contract

To deploy the contract, click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar, select the contract and press "Deploy". Once deployed, an instance would be created and the various functions implemented on the contract can now be interacted with.
