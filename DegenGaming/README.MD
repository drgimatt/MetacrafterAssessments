# Types of Functions - ETH + AVAX - Project

This contains the necessary files for the Create and Mint Token project under the Types of Functions - ETH + AVAX module part of ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course by Metacrafters The project showcases the usage of inheritance of the ERC20 Contract from openzepplin to demonstrate the functionalities of the ERC20 Token.

## Description

This repository contains a .sol file which contains Solidity code which is written to adhere to the requirements specified in the "Create and Mint Token" Project page for "ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course". Since it inherits from the ERC20 Token, the standard functions and events are inherited as well.

## Features

- Transfer funds from one account to another
- Approve an account certain number of funds to spend on behalf of the owner
- Obtain the total supply of the specified account

## Getting Started

### Opening the Contract

This contract is written in Solidity, as such, it can be run by any IDE that is configured to use Solidity. An option available is to use Remix, an online Solidity IDE, is a simple and fast option to run the contract. To get started, go to https://remix.ethereum.org/.

### Compiling the Contract

On the Remix website, create a new file by clicking the "+" icon on the left-hand sidebar and save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the code into the file. To compile the code, click the compiler tab on the left-hand sidebar and set the compiler version to the version specified on the file and click "Compile".

### Running the Contract

To deploy the contract, click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar, select the contract and press "Deploy". Once deployed, an instance would be created and the various functions implemented on the contract can now be interacted with.
